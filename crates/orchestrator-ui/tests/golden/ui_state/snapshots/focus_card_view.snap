Title: Confirm golden snapshot update workflow
Kind: NeedsDecision
Work item: wi-focus
Workflow: Implementing
Session: session sess-focus (Blocked)

Why attention is required:
- The worker needs a decision before it can continue implementation. Session status is Blocked.

Recommended response:
- Answer the worker prompt to unblock progress: Should snapshot updates use ORCHESTRATOR_UPDATE_GOLDENS?

Evidence:
- Latest input request: Should snapshot updates use ORCHESTRATOR_UPDATE_GOLDENS?
- Latest blocker reason: Need confirmation before locking golden workflow
- Latest checkpoint summary: Recorded failing tests and narrowed issue to center view stack rendering
- LogSnippet artifact 'Test output tail' -> artifact://logs/wi-focus?tail=2+failures+in+ui+snapshot+tests
- PR artifact 'Draft PR #138' -> https://github.com/example/orchestrator/pull/138
